# Flight Deal Finder

The purpose of this application is to find flights over the next 6 months at a price that is below the targetted price point that has been set by the user.

## How it works
1) The user will fill the columns for the city and set a price limit for each destination (IATA codes will be automatically filled later).

2) The user needs to create an account in [Tequila](https://tequila.kiwi.com/portal/login) and [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/?g=%2F) to access their APIs.
